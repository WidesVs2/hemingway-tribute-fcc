          Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American
          journalist, novelist, short-story writer, and sportsman. His
          economical and understated style—which he termed the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_theory" target="_blank"
            >iceberg theory</a
          >—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his
          adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from
          later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the
          mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature
          in 1954. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and
          two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story
          collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously.
          Many of his works are considered classics of

                July 21, 1899: Birth of Ernest Hemingway
              </h5>
              Ernest Miller Hemingway is born in Oak Park, Illinois, a place he
              will later describe as a town of "wide lawns and narrow minds." He
              is the second of six children of Clarence Hemingway, a doctor, and
              Grace Hall Hemingway, a music teacher.

              From his infancy, Hemingway's mother begins a strange habit of
              dressing her son like a girl, complete with dresses and long hair,
              and his older sister as a boy, with overalls and cropped hair.
              When Ernest is six, she finally ends the charade and allows him to
              cut his long hair. The damage has already been done. In adulthood,
              his friend John dos Passos will describe Hemingway as the only man
              he ever knew who truly hated his mother.

              seriously injured by a trench mortar and machine gun. The blast
              leaves shell fragments in his legs. The Italian government awards
              him a Silver Medal of Military Valor for dragging a wounded
              Italian soldier to safety after the attack, but his career as an
              ambulance driver is over. While recuperating in a Milan hospital,
              Hemingway falls in love with an American nurse six years his
